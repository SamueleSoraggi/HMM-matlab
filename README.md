# HMM-matlab

Old Matlab implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models with EM, and of Variational bayes Gaussian Mixture Models. The scripts allow you to draw a trajectory with your mouse and model it with a GMM, and implement various versions of the EM/VI inference, including one mixed with genetics algorithms. Produced with an old Matlab version in 2012-2013 fir a MSc. thesis, and still worked in 2019. Since then, it has not been tested.
